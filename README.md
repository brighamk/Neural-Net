This repository includes a Neural Network Project using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. 
The database includes 48 half-hour excerpts of two-channel ambulatory ECG recordings from 47 subjects at the Beth Israel Hospital (BIH) Arrythmia Laboratory between 1975 and 1979. The ECG is an electrocardiogram, which tests for signs of heart disease. 

Twenty-three of the recordings were chosen randomly from a collection of 4000 24-hour ECG recordings that were collected from a population of 60% inpatients and 40% outpatients at BIH. The other 25 recordings were chosen from the same population of patients but specifically included ECG readings with clinically significant arrhythmias. 

In the dataset there are 5 classifications of ECGs: 
N: Normal Beat is coded as a 0
S: Supraventricular premature beat is coded as a 1
V: Premature Ventricular contraction is coded as a 2
F: Fusion of ventricular and normal beat is coded as a 3
Q: Unclassifiable beat is coded as a 4
